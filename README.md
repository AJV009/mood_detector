# mooddetector

Learning to use Azure Cloud Cognitive services and GitHub integration.

A Mood Detector (Partial web app) - Captures your face then detects the moods like Happy or Sad!

Makes use of Azure Cognitive Services (Face API), Flask, Cosmos DB and Azure App Services plugin on VS-Code

Made from - https://github.com/microsoft/hackwithazure/tree/master/workshops/web-ai-mood-detector

I used a conda environment with python 3.7 for the project. Something crashed in 3.8 maybe you can fix it if you'r interested.

- Simply install the requirements.txt and run the picturetaker.py!
- It would take a picture by pressing the spacebar
- Automatically uploads to web page (app.py) which would interact with the Face API -> https://xaj-pyweb-app.azurewebsites.net/
